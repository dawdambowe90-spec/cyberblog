Artificial Intelligence has moved from research labs to our IDEs. In 2026, AI is not just generating text; it's reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks.

## Agentic Workflows

We are moving beyond simple "chatbots" to **agents**.

- **Tools**: Agents can execute code, browse the web, and manage files.
- **Memory**: Maintaining context over long sessions.
- **Planning**: Breaking down complex goals into executable steps.

### The Role of the Developer

Developers are becoming **architects** and **supervisors**. We define the high-level goals and review the implementation details generated by AI.
