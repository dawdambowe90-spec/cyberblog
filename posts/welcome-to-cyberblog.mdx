Welcome to **CyberBlog**. This isn't just another tech blog; it's a demonstration of what's possible with the modern web stack in 2026.

## Why We Built This

The web has evolved. Users demand speed, search engines demand structure, and developers demand a great experience. We combined:

- **Next.js 16 (App Router)** for bleeding-edge performance
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, beautiful UI development
- **MDX** for interactive content components

  "Performance is not just a metric; it's a feature."
</blockquote>

## Key Features

1. **Static Generation**: Blazing fast load times.
2. **Dark Mode**: Built-in system preference detection.
3. **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code blocks.

```javascript
// Example of the clean code we love
const greeting = "Hello, Future!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Stay tuned for more deep dives into modern web architecture.
