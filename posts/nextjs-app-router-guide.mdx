The **App Router** represents the biggest shift in the React ecosystem in years. It allows us to leverage **React Server Components (RSC)** to ship less JavaScript to the client.

## Understanding Server Components

Server Components run *only* on the server. They have zero impact on bundle size.

### When to use Client Components?

Use Client Components when you need interactivity:
- `onClick`, `onChange` listeners
- `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect` hooks
- Browser-only APIs

```jsx
// This runs on the server
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <main>{/* Render data */}</main>;
}
```

## Nested Layouts

One of the most powerful features is nested layouts. You can wrap specific route segments in their own persistent UI shells.

This enables complex dashboard interfaces with minimal state management overhead.
